    The term pragyavan means to be ‘aware’. When an individual is aware, they
    can recognize their own capabilities, fulfill their life’s potential and
    have an undying smile on their face. The path that each individual chooses
    to attain this potential is different since every individual is unique. What
    Pragyavan aims is to provide a platform with diverse options to help people
    attain their best potential. 

    We hope that this ‘awareness’ can then create a ripple effect by connecting us better to our environment and build a peaceful, sustainable society.
