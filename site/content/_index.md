  heading: Our Vision
  text: >
    The term pragyavan means to be ‘aware’. When an individual is aware, they
    can recognize their own capabilities, fulfill their life’s potential and
    have an undying smile on their face. The path that each individual chooses
    to attain this potential is different since every individual is unique. What
    Pragyavan aims is to provide a platform with diverse options to help people
    attain their best potential. 



    We hope that this ‘awareness’ can then create a ripple effect by connecting us better to our environment and build a peaceful, sustainable society.

values:
  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
